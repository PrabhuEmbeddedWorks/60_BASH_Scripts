# 60_BASH_Scripts

The collection of 60 Bash scripts focuses on a wide range of essential Linux terminal functionalities. These scripts include the use of operators, variables, conditionals, loops, and arrays to automate tasks. They cover file operations (e.g., reading, writing, permissions), network connection management (e.g., pinging, checking ports), and process management (e.g., monitoring, killing processes). Additionally, system information scripts gather details about the systemâ€™s performance, disk usage, and hardware specifications, streamlining system administration and improving overall efficiency.
